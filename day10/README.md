**Solution**

Wow, a virtual machine! kind of. Very interesting problem.

At first, I thought the cycle was a useless parameter and skip them
by increase cycle by 2 at each `addx` opcode. Turned out it was a mistake :D

Anyway, today I managed to solve the problem right away with Zig. Quite happy
about the progress.
