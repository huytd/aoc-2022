**Solution:**

This is a warm up challenge, so, there's not much to be said.

It's not neccessary to build the sum array for part 1, but it will be needed for
part 2.

**Tiny bits:**

About file reading, there are 2 popular ways to read a file in Deno:

- Read everything at once using `Deno.readTextFile`
- Read file line by line using the `readLines` method from the `std`

I have the bad habit of reading everything at once, especially for the
quick challenges like this, will build the habit of reading line by line
from now on.
